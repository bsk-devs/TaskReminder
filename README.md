# Task Reminder – Privacy Policy

Last updated: 29 November, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Task Reminder (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application (the “App”).

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

1. Information We Collect
1.1 Information You Provide Directly

The App does not require you to create an account or provide personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number.

However, you may enter information into the App when you use it, including:

Task names and descriptions

Reminder times and repetition schedules

This information is stored locally on your device in the app’s private storage/database and is used only to provide reminder functionality.

1.2 Information Collected Automatically

The App itself does not directly collect analytics or usage data beyond what is necessary to function on your device.

However, third-party services integrated into the App (such as advertising services) may automatically collect certain information, such as:

Device identifiers (e.g., Android advertising ID)

IP address

App usage information (e.g., which screens are viewed)

Device and network information (e.g., device model, OS version, language, network provider)

See Section 3 – Third-Party Services for details.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information described above for the following purposes:

To provide core functionality:

Scheduling and displaying reminders

Storing your tasks and reminder settings locally on your device

To show ads (via third parties):

Displaying banner advertisements in the App using Google AdMob

We do not sell your personal information.

3. Third-Party Services (AdMob)

The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements.

AdMob (Google) may collect and use data as described in Google’s own privacy policy, including:

Device identifiers

Advertising ID

IP address

App usage data

Location information (approximate), if enabled at the system level

This data may be used for:

Serving and personalizing ads

Measuring ad performance

Detecting and preventing fraud or abuse

You can learn more about how Google uses data from apps that use its services in Google’s Privacy Policy:
https://policies.google.com/privacy

You may also control ad personalization via your device settings (for example, “Opt out of Ads Personalization” or “Limit Ad Tracking”) depending on your Android version.

4. Data Storage and Retention

Task data and reminders

Stored locally on your device in the app’s database.

We do not have access to your tasks or reminders on our own servers.

Advertising / usage data collected by third parties

Stored and retained according to the policies of Google and any other third-party service providers.

We do not directly control their retention periods.

If you uninstall the App, the locally stored task and reminder data are removed from your device.

5. Children’s Privacy

Our App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at the email address below so we can take appropriate action.

6. Your Choices and Controls

Because the App stores your task data locally and does not require an account:

You can delete all your task/reminder data by:

Clearing the App’s data in your device settings, or

Uninstalling the App from your device.

For advertising and data collected by AdMob/Google:

You can adjust ad personalization in your device’s Google settings (e.g., “Ads” → “Delete advertising ID” or “Opt out of Ads Personalization”, depending on Android version).

You can also review and manage your Google account privacy settings via Google’s privacy tools.

7. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect information stored in the App, including relying on Android’s application sandboxing and private storage.

However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. You are responsible for keeping your device secure (e.g., using a device lock, not rooting/jailbreaking, etc.).

8. International Users

If you use the App from a location outside the country where the developer is based, your information may be processed in that country or other countries where Google or its partners operate. Those locations may have different data protection laws than your country.

9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.

We recommend that you review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted will constitute your acknowledgment and acceptance of the updated policy.
